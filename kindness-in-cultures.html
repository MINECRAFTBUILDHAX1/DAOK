        <h1>Kindness in Different Cultures</h1>
        <p>Kindness takes many forms across different cultures. In Japan, the practice of 'omotenashi' emphasizes deep hospitality and selflessness. In India, 'seva' is the act of selfless service, deeply rooted in spiritual traditions.</p>
        <p>In Nordic countries, communal support and egalitarian values encourage acts of kindness, while in many Indigenous cultures, reciprocity and generosity play a significant role in community well-being.</p>
