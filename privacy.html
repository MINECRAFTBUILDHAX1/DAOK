                We take reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect. However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

            <li><strong>Third-Party Services</strong><br>
                We may use third-party services, such as Google Analytics, to monitor and analyze website traffic. These services may collect and process your data according to their privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies if you're concerned about how your data is used.
